VideoPlayerKit
==============

We know how hard making a custom video player is. That is why we created VideoPlayerKit. Using VideoPlayerKit is easy to use. All controls, progress bar, and airplay are already set up to make everyone life easier.

Use the sample project to see how VideoPlayerKit works.

# Using the sample project
Download the github project and use the Makefile to gather all the pods require for VideoPlayerKit. Use the following command:
``` objective-c
Make clean setup
```

# Installation Instruction:

## In View Controller that will contain the video player:

### Import VideoPlayerKit.h
``` objective-c
import "VideoPlayerKit.h"
```

### Initializing video player
``` objective-c
[VideoPlayerKit initWithContainingViewController:optionalTopView:hideTopViewWithControls:];
```
Make sure that the view controller that contains the video player is passed into the first parameter. This is used when a modal fullscreen occurs. The optional top view is a view that will be at the top of the video player. This can be use to put any additional buttons or labels. The third parameter is a boolean that will be use to check if the top view should hide with the video player controls. If this is set to NO, it is still possible to hide the top view only on certain times given the situation using the two notifications: kVideoPlayerWillHideControlsNotification and kVideoPlayerWillShowControlsNotification.

### Top View Edge Inset
``` objective-c
setControlsEdgeInsets
```
If a top view is set, use this to offset the controls so it accounts for the top view. Usually you'll only want to change the edge inset's top parameter but the option is left open to change it entirely.

### Playing video on inline player
``` objective-c
playVideoWithTitle:URL:videoID:isStreaming:playInFullScreen:
```
The method will automatically start playing the video that is given in the url. The title parameter is used for the label that will appear near the bottom of the video player. The videoID and isStreaming parameters are used mainly for analytics tracking. The last parameter, playInFullScreen, is a boolean that when set to YES, the video will play automatically in fullscreen.

### Playing video on non-inline player
To play a video on a non-inline player, you must add the video player view controller's view as a subview of the current view. Then you follow the same route as the inline player playVideoWithTitle:URL:videoID:isStreaming:playInFullScreen: to play the video.

## VideoPlayerDelegate

### Event tracking
``` objective-c
trackEvent:videoID:title:
```
This method is used for analytic event tracking. The first parameter will be one of three events: kTrackEventVideoStart, kTrackEventVideoLiveStart, kTrackEventVideoComplete. The videoID and title will be the same ones that was passed into the method playVideoWithTitle:URL:videoID:isStreaming:playInFullScreen:

### Fullscreen toggle switch
``` objective-c
BOOL fullScreenToggled
```
This property will be set to YES whenever the video player is fullscreen modally

## Optional Methods

### Launch video player in fullscreen
``` objective-c
launchFullScreen
```

### Minimize video player from fullscreen
``` objective-c
minimizeVideo
```

### Play and pause video
``` objective-c
playPauseHandler
```
Plays the video if paused. Pauses the video if playing.

## Optional properties

### Check if fullscreen mode is toggled
``` objective-c
fullScreenModeToggled
```

### Set the end time to static or dynamic
``` objective-c
showStaticEndTime
```
Set this boolean to yes if the end time should just be a static label. Default setting is NO which will make the end time decrease as the video plays.

### Get current video info
``` objective-c
currentVideoInfo
```
A dictionary which uses these keys: @"title" for title of video, @"videoID" for id of video, @"isStreaming" to check if it is a live video.

### Check if video is playing
``` objective-c
isPlaying
```

### Allow fullscreen view to be in portrait
``` objective-c
allowPortraitFullscreen
```
Default fullscreen is landscape. For portrait fullscreen, mark this property to YES.
